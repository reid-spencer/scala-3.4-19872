# scala-3.4-19872
A case for a scala issue 19872.  Two commits are provided as detailed below, the working version 
with Scala 3.3.3 and the failing version with Scala 3.4.0.

Working version with Scala 3.3.3 @bb64512e yields:

Failing version with Scala 3.4.0 @baec8b7b yields:

Note that the `-rewrite` and `-source` options were given on the compilation
but that the rewrite did not happen. At the very least remove that last line
of the message. It would be better to have it actually do the rewrite.
